## IoT-based Smart Vehicle Security System (SVSS) ðŸš—ðŸ”’

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my final year project: IoT-based Smart Vehicle Security System (SVSS)! This project addresses key vehicle safety issues through innovative technology solutions:

1. **Automatic Headlight Dimmer**: Employing LDR sensors to automatically adjust headlights, preventing glare and enhancing nighttime driving safety.
2. **Ultrasonic Parking Aid**: Utilizing ultrasonic sensors to assist in parking and navigating traffic, reducing the risk of scratches and damage.
3. **Accident SOS Alert**: Implementing GSM and GPS modules to send SMS alerts with the vehicle's current location in the event of an accident, ensuring quick assistance.

This project integrates IoT technology to create a comprehensive, real-world vehicle safety system. Explore the repository to see how these features are implemented and contribute to making our roads safer!
